# Sunrise ERP — Session Handoff

**Written:** 6 September 2026 · **revised 7 September 2026** (Part 2)
**Branch:** `part-1-foundation` — **27 commits ahead of `main`, nothing pushed** (22 code, 5 documentation)
**Repo:** `C:\Users\SHIVANSH\OneDrive\Documents\AGENTS\school-management-system\`
**Remote:** https://github.com/shivansh2277/School-management-system

Every number below was measured on 6 September 2026, not recalled. Anything
unverified says so.

> This supersedes `Sunrise-HANDOFF.md` (in the parent AGENTS folder) for
> everything about the ERP work. That document still describes the v0 demo
> accurately, **except the demo logins, which have changed** — see §5.

## 1. What this project now is

A **multi-tenant School ERP sold to separate, independent schools** — not
branches of one school. That distinction was confirmed explicitly and shapes
the whole data model: a tenant is a customer.

The design document is `docs/ERP_BLUEPRINT.md`. **§0 holds the 21 locked
product decisions and wins over anything else in that document.** Read §0 first;
the rest was written before those answers.

Delivery is **four checkpointed parts** (§12). Four checkpoints is not four
sessions — Parts 3 and 4 will each span several.

| Part | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation: tenancy, enrolments, RBAC, audit, jobs, documents | **backend complete** |
| 2 | Admission, including the public online portal | **backend complete; Checkpoint 2 passes in tests** |
| 3 | Fees rebuild + attendance + timetable | not started |
| 4 | Examinations, HR/payroll, transport, communication, reports | not started |

---

## 2. Verified current state

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Backend tests | **222 passing**, ~33 s |
| Database tables | 50 |
| Alembic migrations | 14 (verified from empty **on Postgres**, then seed, then worker) |
| API surface | 109 paths, 135 operations |
| Permissions / system roles | 46 / 13 |
| Job handlers | `fees.overdue_sweep`, `fees.generate_invoices`, `admission.offer_sweep`, `system.heartbeat` |
| Demo school | 100 students, 10 sections, 12 teachers, 98 guardians |

```bash
cd backend
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q                    # 222 passed
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe seed.py
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe worker.py --once                # runs due jobs
```

## 3. The eight commits, and why each exists

1. **`2df73e8` Tenancy + academic years** — `schools` is the tenant root and
   replaces `school_settings` (which was reached via a hardcoded `id=1`).
   `academic_years` replaces the `String(9)` that was denormalised onto two
   tables with nothing keeping them in agreement. A partial unique index allows
   at most one current year per school.
2. **`965f1e6` Enrolments** — the largest change. `class_section_id` and
   `roll_no` moved off `students` onto `enrolments`. A student's class is a fact
   about a *year*; promotion used to overwrite it and silently re-parent all
   history.
3. **`c37687d` Promotion** — year-end rollover that only creates rows. Preview
   is separate from commit and writes nothing.
4. **`f490044` RBAC** — 33 permissions, 10 system roles, scoped grants,
   replacing four hardcoded roles.
5. **`e6a2186` Audit + sequences** — append-only log with mandatory reasons on
   destructive actions; gapless document numbering under a row lock.
6. **`2ca4dd7` Demo school + Assignments retired** — 10 classes × 10 students;
   web Assignments removed per §0.17 (kept in the mobile app).
7. **`843250a` Worker + CI** — Postgres-backed job queue, worker process,
   GitHub Actions, Dockerfile, compose stack, `DEPLOY.md`.
8. **`02c5f56` Documents** — polymorphic documents + object storage. This is
   what Part 2 was blocked on.

Four more since (6 September, later the same day):

9. **`71be808` Test-schema reset** — the suite would not start: `sunrise_test`
    still held the v0 schema and `drop_all` orders drops from the model
    metadata, so a leftover `students.class_section_id` FK blocked it. Postgres
    now drops and recreates the schema.
10. **`0a4a846` Notice scope leak** — the parent branch of `notices.visible_to`
    selected enrolment sections without joining `Student`, a cartesian product
    that showed every parent every class's notices. SQLAlchemy had warned about
    it on every run.
11. **`45dcb69` Admin student CRUD** — the enrolment split had broken both
    halves and nothing tested them: create raised `NameError` (missing imports),
    and moving a child to another section wrote `class_section_id` onto
    `Student`, where the column no longer exists, and returned 200.
12. **`cdf89e4` Settings, module flags, custom fields** — §3.15 levels 1-3 plus
    the module-registry seam. Endpoints under `/admin/configuration`;
    `/admin/settings` was already the school profile.
13. **`2c7107e` Employees and guardians** — `teachers` -> `employees`
    (`employee_id` -> `employee_code`, plus `employee_type`), `parents` ->
    `guardians` with the §0.7 cross-link, `parent_student` ->
    `student_guardian` with a closed `relation` list and one primary contact
    per child under a partial unique index. `class_teacher_id`,
    `class_subject_teacher.teacher_id` and the /teacher and /parent URL
    prefixes deliberately kept.

### Part 2, 7 September

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `cb41e5d` | Cycles, seat configuration, enquiry register with a follow-up log |
| `487228b` | Applications: drafts, submission, the soft-warning rules |
| `b1fea5d` | The public portal — the only unauthenticated surface |
| `ce475c5` | Document checklist and the gate before a decision |
| `7e07107` | Assessments and interviews, panel scores kept independent |
| `bdd958d` | Merit list, decisions, offers, waitlist, expiry job |
| `e03576d` | Atomic conversion — **Checkpoint 2** |
| `4af03bd` | Dashboard, funnel, seat utilisation, rejection analysis |

**Checkpoint 2 is a test, not a claim:**
`tests/test_admission_conversion.py::test_checkpoint_2_portal_to_enrolled_student`
applies on the public portal, verifies documents, admits, offers, collects the
fee, converts — then logs in as the new student, checks the enrolment, the
guardian link, the migrated documents and an invoice from the next billing run.
No manual database work anywhere in it.

Design decisions in Part 2 that a later session should not undo:

- **Address, previous school and declarations are JSON columns on
  `applications`.** A form step writes and reads each whole and nothing queries
  inside them; a column each would be forty columns and three tables for
  nothing. Medical is the exception — its own table, its own permission (§15).
- **Applicant documents reuse the polymorphic `documents` table**, and are
  re-pointed at the student at conversion rather than copied.
- **`admission_decisions.reason` and `admission_offers.expires_on` are NOT
  NULL.** Both are §5.1.9 rules expressed as constraints rather than
  intentions.
- **The public portal returns identical 404s** for an unknown school, a
  suspended one, and one with the module off — and for a wrong application
  number versus a wrong date of birth. Weakening that turns it into an
  enumeration oracle.
- **Assessment and interview are their own tables, not `exams`/`marks`.** Those
  hang off an enrolment, which an applicant does not have.

---

## 4. Things that would be expensive to rediscover

**The migration test runs on SQLite, and SQLite hides Postgres bugs.** It does
not enforce foreign keys and it accepts `1` for a boolean; both cost time on
6 September. The Postgres path is exercised only by CI (which has still never
run) or by hand:

```bash
python -c "from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text; import os;   [c.execute(text('DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public'))    for c in [create_engine(os.environ['DATABASE_URL']).begin().__enter__()]]"
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe seed.py && ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe worker.py --once
```

**The test suite does not exercise the migrations.** `tests/conftest.py` builds
its schema with `Base.metadata.create_all`, straight from the models. A batch
`alter_column` in the tenancy migration dropped `updated_at`'s `server_default`,
leaving a NOT NULL column nothing could insert into — and no test could see it.
`tests/test_migrations.py` now migrates, seeds and runs a worker for real, and
CI does the same. **Do not delete that test to make the suite faster.**

**`BCRYPT_ROUNDS` is configurable and tests use 4.** Seeding 210 accounts at the
production work factor was ~70 s of every run. This changes the work factor, not
the behaviour. Never lower it outside tests.

**Reads must not write.** v0's `fees.refresh_overdue()` committed from inside a
GET. That is gone: `presented_status()` computes how an invoice reads *now*, and
the scheduled `fees.overdue_sweep` job moves the stored value.

**Scope is not the same as permission.** A guardian and an office clerk both
hold `students.profile.read`. The guardian holds it at `self` scope; admin
routes pass `school_wide=True`. Getting this wrong once already exposed the
whole student roster to a parent in development.

**SQLite returns naive datetimes** even for `timestamptz` columns, and comparing
one against an aware `now` raises rather than returning False. `services/jobs.py`
normalises with `_utc()`.

---

## 5. Demo logins — **these changed**

Admission numbers now come from a sequence in the format decided in §0.21:
`YYYY` + a six-digit counter. The old `SPS2024001` no longer exists.

| Role | Login | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@sunrisepublic.edu` | `Admin@123` |
| Teacher | `TCH001` | `Teacher@123` |
| Student | `2024000001` | `Student@123` |
| Parent | `9876500001` | `Parent@123` |

`TCH001` still class-teaches 10-A and teaches it Mathematics — the walkthrough
depends on it, and the seed pins that deliberately. `2024000001` is roll 1 of
10-A. The demo parent still has exactly two children so the child switcher has
something to switch between.

Tests no longer hard-code these: `conftest._login_id_in()` resolves a student by
where they sit, so seed ordering can change without breaking the suite.

---

## 6. Open work

### Part 2 — what is not built

- **No admission UI at all.** The whole module is API-only; §5.1.3 lists
  eighteen screens and the web dashboard has none of them.
- **No communication.** §5.1.6 wants every stage transition to trigger a
  notification — acknowledgement, document reminder, hall ticket, offer letter,
  expiry warning. Email is a Part 4 deliverable, so the triggers have nowhere
  to go yet and are not stubbed.
- **No hall tickets or offer letters as documents.** The data is all there;
  nothing renders a PDF.
- **Transport interest is captured and goes nowhere** — `transport_required` is
  stored, and Part 4 builds the assignment request it should seed.
- **Reapplication linking exists as a column** (`previous_application_id`) but
  no endpoint sets it.

### Part 1 — infrastructure still owed

**The backend list from §12 is now done.** What Part 1 still owes is
infrastructure and proof rather than code: a real `docker compose up` on the
Oracle box, a backup whose restore has actually been performed, and CI that has
run at least once. Checkpoint 1 does not pass until the restore happens — see
§7.

The web dashboard and the mobile app are also not caught up; the API shapes they
read have moved (§7).

---

## 7. Known limits and things not verified

- **Docker is not installed on this machine.** `docker-compose.yml` and
  `backend/Dockerfile` are syntax-checked only. They need a real
  `docker compose up` on the Oracle box before anyone trusts them.
- **Nothing is pushed.** All eight commits exist only on this laptop. The owner
  wants the exact file list shown before any push.
- **CI has never run.** The workflow is written but no push has triggered it.
- **The web dashboard has not been opened** against the new backend. It
  typechecks (`npx tsc --noEmit` is clean) and builds, but several API shapes
  changed — settings, class creation, student rows, and now `employee_code`
  and `guardian_name`/`guardian_phone`, which the two pages that read them were
  updated for. Typechecking is not the same as running it; expect breakage.
- **The mobile app has not been touched or tested** since the enrolment change.
  Its API calls almost certainly need updating.
- **`/admin/configuration` has no UI at all.** Settings, module switches and
  custom fields are API-only; §0.18 says the configuration screens must be
  usable by a records clerk, and that screen does not exist yet.
- **Zero frontend tests** still. Unchanged from v0 and still a real gap.
- **The old Vercel/Neon deployment is now stale** — the schema there predates
  all seven migrations. Hosting moves to Oracle Cloud (`DEPLOY.md`).

## 8. Still open for product discussion

From ERP_BLUEPRINT §16, none blocking Part 1:

| # | Question | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| A | A real Lucknow school's payroll structure to validate the component model | Part 4 |
| B | Confirm Uttar Pradesh levies no professional tax (assumed, shipped disabled) | Part 4 |
| C | Does the late-fee clock stop when the next invoice generates, or keep accruing? | Part 3 |
| D | The exact CBSE report card layout the target school expects | Part 4 |

---

## 9. Where to start next session

1. Read `docs/ERP_BLUEPRINT.md` **§0** (decisions) and **§12** (the four parts).
2. `git log --oneline main..HEAD` for what changed and why — the commit messages
   carry the reasoning, deliberately.
3. Run the suite to confirm the state above.
4. Then either finish Part 1 (§6 here) or start Part 2 — Admission, specified in
   depth at ERP_BLUEPRINT §5.1.

The memory file `sunrise-erp-build.md` carries the same state in short form for
a session that starts cold.
